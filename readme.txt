Basically, I have download a dataset from this website: https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices, specifically the prices of Resale flats from Jan 2017 onwards, available here: https://data.gov.sg/dataset/7a339d20-3c57-4b11-a695-9348adfd7614/download. 

I intend to use the various techniques I've learnt, such as Ridge, Lasso, LinearRegressions and clustering to create a basic, supervised Machine Learning model to predict the housing prices of resale flats. 

There are a variety of factors that contribute to this dependent variable, for example:
1) Floor area (sqm)
2) Number of rooms
3) Floor
and I'm going to use Lasso to determine which variables affect the price of housing the most, and conduct a regression analysis using the top 3 (estimated) variables.

Hello World!

Welcome to my first project - an attempt to predict the prices of HDB flats in Singapore using basic linear regression models.
I'm doing this to incorporate some new techniques that I've learnt using Scikit-learn and other Python packages like Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib to practice my programming.

I don't expect my model to be very robust,  but I need the practice.

If anyone chances upon this repository, please feel free to help me out - I'm still relatively new to programming - and I'll try to remember to annotate my work as I go along, which is something I'm not used to doing on a regular basis.

Cheers,
Zy
