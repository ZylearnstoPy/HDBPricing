Hello World!

Welcome to my first project - an attempt to predict the prices of HDB flats in Singapore using basic linear regression models.
I'm doing this to incorporate some new techniques that I've learnt using Scikit-learn and other Python packages like Pandas, NumPy and matplotlib to practice my programming.

I don't expect my model to be very robust,  but I need the practice.

If anyone chances upon this repository, please feel free to help me out - I'm still relatively new to programming - and I'll try to remember to annotate my work as I go along, which is something I'm not used to doing on a regular basis.

Cheers,
Zy
